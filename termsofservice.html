				  <p>Dispute Resolution. Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND ASCENT AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION IN SINGAPORE TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE ORDINARY COURTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION RULES OF THE SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION CENTRE (“SIAC”) (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE EULA OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. The place of arbitration shall be in Singapore and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed by the President of the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC. The arbitral award made and granted by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and incontestable, may be enforced by the Parties against the assets of the other Parties wherever those assets are located or may be found and may be used as a basis for judgement thereon in Singapore or elsewhere. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit http://www.siac.org.sg/.org for more information about arbitration. </p>

You and ASCENT agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. </p>
				  <p>Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against ASCENT must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section.

				  <p>Modifications. In the event that ASCENT makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision , you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to ASCENT’s, in which case your account with ASCENT and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this EULA. </p>
